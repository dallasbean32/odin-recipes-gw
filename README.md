odin recipes

After quite a bit of floundering around with git commands, I've finally successfully linked my odin-recipes
repository to my computer. I appreciate the practice I performed in pursuit of this, as it answered several
questions I did not know that I actually had.

For now, I suppose I'll be practicing HTML & CSS stuff in this particular repo, so here goes nothing!
